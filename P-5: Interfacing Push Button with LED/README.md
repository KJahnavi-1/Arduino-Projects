# ðŸ”˜ Interfacing Push Button to LED

This Arduino project demonstrates how to **control an LED using a push button**. When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON; when released, the LED turns OFF. This is one of the most basic and essential beginner projects for learning digital input and output.

## ðŸ”§ Components Required

- 1 x Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 x Push button  
- 1 x LED  
- 1 x 220Î© resistor (for the LED)  
- 1 x 10kÎ© resistor (for the button pull-down)  
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Diagram

**Connections:**
- Push button â†’ Pin 5 (with 10kÎ© resistor to GND as pull-down)  
- LED (Anode) â†’ Pin 13 through 220Î© resistor  
- LED Cathode â†’ GND

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The push button is connected to **digital pin 5** as an input.
- The LED is connected to **digital pin 13** as an output.
- `digitalRead(5)` checks the state of the button:
  - If **HIGH** â†’ LED turns ON  
  - If **LOW** â†’ LED turns OFF
